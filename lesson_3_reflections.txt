When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To collaborate with others!


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that you know what changes are happening when. Sometimes you'll be working on a branch and need the base master file to stay the same while you work on the new branch.
