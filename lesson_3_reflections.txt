When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To collaborate with others!


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that you know what changes are happening when. Sometimes you'll be working on a branch and need the base master file to stay the same while you work on the new branch. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks create a new repository in your own GitHub. Which includes all of the commits in that original repositories. You are basically creating a new version, that's based on the repository you forked.
- Clones... this copies a repository from GitHub to your local branch.
- Branches you would use when you are a collaborator and therefore have permission to make changes to a repository. You can branch off to add a new feature that you hope to be a part of the master branch or included in the official production code.
