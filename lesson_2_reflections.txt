What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a new repository so that you can store a history of versions/commits.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the repository holds commits. The staging area holds files that are about to be committed. The working directory holds the actual current files.
